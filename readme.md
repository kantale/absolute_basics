# Introduction
So, you decided to learn a new programming language! This is Great!

Straggling to learn the basics of a new programming language might be difficult. Keeping a list of the basic tasks that you need to accomplish before moving to more advanced tasks might be helpful. This is what this list is about. 

Some notes:
1. I tried to order tasks from easier to more difficult but this is subjective. So feel free to skip/move to the list as you please.
2. Some languages may not support (or support indirectly) some of these tasks. Do not spent much time over-engineering a task. Most tasks should take no more than 5 lines of code (in most languages)
3. This list is not about "learning programming" or how to think with algorithms. There are many great resources about this elsewhere. This list is only about keeping track of learning how to do the absolute basics in a new programming language. Being confindent on doing these tasks can help you move forward.
4. This list is not complete! Merge Requests are welcome!
